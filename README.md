# interactiverating
This is a nice, small project to practice handling user interactions and updating the DOM. Perfect for anyone who has learned the basics of JavaScript!

This is a solution to the Interactive rating component challenge on Frontend Mentor which involves handling user interaction and updating the DOM.

I used HTML5, CSS, & JQUERY for this project.

The most difficult part for me was getting the rating buttons to highlight, and unhighlighting when another button was clicked.

I really enjoyed using Jquery with this one
